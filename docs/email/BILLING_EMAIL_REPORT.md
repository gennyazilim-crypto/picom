# Billing Email Report

**Status:** DISABLED UNTIL BILLING EXISTS

**Reviewed:** 2026-07-15

## Result

Templates exist for confirmation, payment failure, and refund status, but Picom has no certified production billing source. No billing email is emitted until an authoritative billing webhook and legal approval exist.

## Production contract

- Sender identity: **Picom <info@picom.gg>**.
- Default Reply-To: **info@picom.gg**.
- SMTP credentials are server-only and must never use a VITE_ variable.
- Renderer code submits named intents to the protected Edge API; it cannot select arbitrary From addresses or relay raw email.
- Delivery state is recorded by the durable PostgreSQL queue and Ubuntu worker.

## Security and privacy

RLS denies direct client access to operational email records. Queue claims and completion are service-role-only. Logs and admin views expose domains, status, correlation identifiers, and stable error codes rather than message bodies or credentials.

## Evidence and next action

Repository evidence is covered by `npm run email:smoke` and `npm run email:sender:scan`. Live claims remain blocked unless this report explicitly records verified provider or hosted evidence.
